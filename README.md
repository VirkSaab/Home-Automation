# Home-Automation

#### Home Automation System with various sensors such as motion, gas leakage, sound, etc. for security and appliances control.


Home automation system built on Arduino Uno R3 microcontroller along with Light sensor, Motion detector, Temperature sensor, Gas sensor, Sound sensor, Buzzer, LED lights, Crystal Display and Arduino IDE 1.6.8.
Home automation is the residential extension of building automation and involves the control and automation of lighting, temperature sensing, appliances, and security. The System is controlled by Arduino microcontroller which is connected to a computer for power as well as for monitoring the outputs of different sensors using serial monitor on Arduino IDE.
Security sensors such as motion detector and gas sensor interact with buzzer and LED for alerts.
Display unit provides the information of temperature and special messages.
